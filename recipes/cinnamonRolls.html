    <p>The best homemade cinnamon rolls ever! If you love gooey cinnamon
         buns, THIS is the recipe with the secret ingredient that makes all 
         the difference. Everyone raves about these better-than-Cinnabon 
         homemade rolls.</p>

         <h2> Ingredients</h2>

         <h4> Dough </h4>

         <ul>
            <li> 1 Cup warm milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salted butte</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (divided)
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h4> Filling </h4>

         <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
         </ul>

         <h4> Frosting </h4>

         <ul>
            <li>6 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/3 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon maple extract </li>

         </ul>

         <h2> Steps </h2>
         
         <ol>
            <li>Pour the warm milk in the bowl of 
                a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast 
                overtop.</li>

             <li>Add the eggs, butter and sugar.
                 Mix until combined. </li>

             <li>Add in salt and 4 cups (save the 
                 other ½ cup and add only if you 
                need it) of flour and mix using the 
                beater blade just until the ingredients 
                are barely combined. Allow the mixture to 
                rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time 
                to soak up the liquids.</li>

            <li>Scrape the dough off the beater blade 
                and remove it. Attach the dough hook.</li>

            <li>Beat the dough on medium speed, adding 
                in up to ½ cup more flour if needed 
                to form a dough. Knead for 5-7 minutes 
                or until the dough is elastic and smooth.
                 **The dough should be tacky and will 
                still be sticking to the sides of the bowl. 
                That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more 
                flour at this point. We generally add about 
                 4 ½ cups, but start with 4 cups.</li>

            <li>Spray a large bowl with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>Use a rubber spatula to remove the dough 
                from the mixer bowl and place it in the 
                greased large bowl. </li>

            <li> Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper.</li>

            <li> Set the bowl in a warm place and allow 
                the dough to rise until double. I like to 
                turn on the oven to the lowest setting for 
                1-2 minutes. Then turn off the oven and place
                 the dough to rise in there. It normally takes
                  about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not 
                  allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon 
                  rolls will be airy.</li>

            <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon 
                filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter,
                 brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. 
                 Set aside.</li>

            <li> Sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. 
                Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat and sprinkle 
                the top of the dough with additional flour. </li>

            <li> Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 
                24×15" rectangle. (the size of the rectangle can 
                vary…it does not have to be exact!)
                Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling 
                over the whole dough rectangle.</li>

            <li> Starting on the long end, roll the dough up tightly
                 jelly roll style. 
                Cut into 12 slices and place in a greased 9×13 baking 
                pan.****
                Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes 
                or until nearly double.
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>

            <li> Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t
                make it hot…you just don’t want it cold. It should 
                be warm to the touch.
                Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over 
                the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and 
                around the rolls.
                Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes, until the rolls
                are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are 
                cooked through.</li>

            <li>While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream 
                cheese frosting.
                In a large bowl, combine the softened cream 
                cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well.
                Add in your favorite extract and the powdered
                 sugar. Beat until combined.
                Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls.
                Store in an airtight container.</li>
